# HelloXAML
Is an skeleton for few .NET even mobile developer to learn and develop Desktop Application in WPF with MVVM Pattern. I do believe MVVM Pattern is the most common pattern followed by MVP Pattern in GUI Application

# How to use
Just, <b>clone and go!</b> That is it. Oh yeah, make sure you've install `.NET Desktop development` in order to build and debug

# What benefits you'll get?
For me, this is an 'introduction' to GUI Development such as Desktop and Mobile environment since I use the MVVM, Property Change Pattern, and Attribute Method Pattern. 
Not only that, you will learn about XAML markup language. The most common markup language used in MAUI, WinUI, Xamarin, and WPF (of course).
Even though XAML is not for most mobile (like Android or iOS), but at least you'll get the most big picture of GUI develop architecture

# What can I do with it?
Whatever you like! Heck even let's build WPF Communities in Indonesia
Seriously, whatever you like. Go ahead! Make it self hosted, whatever you like. Go ahead, just fork and give it a star! Even contribute with some bug fix and improvements in order to build a healthy communities!
